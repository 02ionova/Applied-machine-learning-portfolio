## üî¨ 1. DNA Classifier

**Goal:**
To classify DNA sequences into categories based on their nucleotide composition and structural features.

**Methods:**

* Data preprocessing: tokenization, encoding nucleotide sequences into numerical form.
* Applied machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest).
* Performed feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
* Evaluated model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

**Results:**
Achieved a robust model capable of distinguishing DNA sequence types with high accuracy. Demonstrated ability to handle biological datasets and design end-to-end ML workflows.

## üö¢ 2. Data Preprocessing & Binary Classification (Titanic Survival Prediction)

**Goal:**
To predict passenger survival on the Titanic using demographic and travel-related features.

**Methods:**

* Cleaned and preprocessed mixed-type data (numerical, categorical, and missing values).
* Created new features (e.g., title extraction, family size).
* Compared multiple classification models: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors.
* Performed cross-validation, scaling (Min-Max, StandardScaler), and hyperparameter tuning.

**Results:**
The optimized model reached over **75% accuracy**, highlighting the impact of proper data preprocessing and model selection on predictive performance.

## üìà 3. Regression ‚Äî Life Expectancy Prediction

**Goal:**
To predict **life expectancy** across countries and years based on socio-economic and health-related indicators.

**Methods:**

* Cleaned and transformed data, handling missing values and outliers.
* Implemented multiple regression models: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and a custom Random Forest implementation.
* Used normalization and feature importance analysis to interpret results.
* Evaluated models with **RMSE** and **MAE** metrics.

**Results:**
Developed a regression model accurately estimating life expectancy values. Demonstrated strong understanding of regression techniques, feature relationships, and model evaluation.
